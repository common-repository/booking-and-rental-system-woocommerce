1. To install the plugin go to the WordPress codex: http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins or you can install manually http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How Does General Pricing Work ? =
Admin can set general price from the back-end. It’s just like default pricing type of woo-commerce. During booking, the price calculates depending on that price. For example, suppose you set General price as 10$ . Now from front-end if anyone book three days the price calculate as ( 10$ + 10$ + 10$ ) = 30$

= How Does Hourly Pricing work ? =
If you total rental or booking day less than 1 day then the booking cost will be calculated as hourly price rate. You can set hourly price from product backend. It works as following. Suppose you set per hour price as 10$ from product backend . Now if your total rental day becomes less than 1 day like 2 hours then the booking cost will be 10*2 = 20 $. If your total booking or rental days becomes more than 1 day then the hourly price will not work. There is 1 hour late count to fulfill days. e.g. if booking range is 1 day 1 hour. It will cost for 1 day. If booking range is 1 day 2 hours (or more than 2 hours), then it will cost for 2 days. This is the meaning of late count (1 hour). When 1 hour exceded it will count it as a day.

= Same product multiple item booking =
Sorry, this feature isn't currently available. But it will cooming very soon.

= Are RnB payment gateways supported ? =
For payment gateway : our plugins is standard wooCommerce extension. It supports all payment gateways which are supported by wooCommerce. You can check all supported payment gateway from here https://woocommerce.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/payment-gateways/.+ By default , it provides PayPal, Direct bank transfer and Cash on Delivery payment method.

= Does it work on multisite ? =
Yes, Our plugin works fine on multisite. For here you can read one of our customer review regarding this. It took some time to find out but now I can confirm that this plugin works on multisite. The trick is that you can’t activate WooCommerce or this plugin on network level but you must do it on sub-site level .
